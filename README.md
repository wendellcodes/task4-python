# 📁 Folder and File Creator with Random Fruits

## 📑 About
Simple Python code created purely for training purposes.  
The idea was to practice file handling (`os`, `shutil`), working with folders, and writing random data into files.

This project has no professional purpose.  
It's just an exercise to practice what I'm learning.

## 🚀 Features
- Create a folder with the name chosen by the user.
- Create 3 files inside the folder, with names provided by the user.
- Each file receives a random fruit written inside.
- If the folder already exists, it will be deleted and recreated.
- After creating, it lists all the files in the folder.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- File handling in Python (`os`, `shutil`)
- Random data generation (`random.choice()`)
- Use of `time.sleep()` to create pauses between actions
- Working with folder paths (`os.path.join()`)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a simple training project, made just to practice basic file manipulation in Python.  
It may contain bugs or simplified logic since it was created purely for learning purposes.

## 🛠️ Technologies
